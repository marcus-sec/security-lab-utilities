Description: This is just a really silly simple app to give me a clickable button I can toss in a corner of my other monitor to quickly copy and paste an IP.

When doing writeups I find it handy because I will often over write what is on my clipboard to copy my last relevant command into notion. When doing so the target IP is no longer there, and typing it out gets tedious so this is handy.

Instructions:

Install Dependencies:
pip install flask

note: this is on kali already so you can skip this if you're on an updated kali box

Run the little app:
python3 clipboard.py

Open the app in your browser  
Put whatever you want in the text box  
Click the button when you want that value back in your clipboard
